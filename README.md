# Asynchronus-FIFO
This project implements an asynchronous FIFO for safe data transfer between different clock domains.

**Run the simulation on EDA Playground**:

## Features
- Dual clock support (`wclk`, `rclk`)
- Gray code pointer synchronization
- Overflow and underflow detection
- Parameterized depth and width
